# SureMint: Proposal for a Low-Volatility Two-Token Crypto System

## Project Overview
SureMint is a proposal to develop a novel cryptocurrency system focused on achieving low volatility instead of striving for a perfectly stable peg. By leveraging a two-token mechanism, the system uses:
- **SureMint (SMT):** A low-volatility token intended as the primary medium of exchange.
- **GovernanceMint (GMT):** A governance token designed to absorb market fluctuations and support system dynamics.

## Motivation
Traditional stablecoin designs aim for perfect price stability, but our research shows that maintaining a 1:1 peg using a two-token system has inherent challenges. SureMint offers a more achievable alternative by targeting low volatility. The key objectives of the project are to:
1. **Implement a two-token system** featuring a low-volatility token called SureMint.
2. **Prove that a stablecoin based on a two-token system is fundamentally impossible** to maintain perfectly.
3. **Validate the low-volatility assumption** by demonstrating that such a system remains robust against market attacks.

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Implementation of the SureMint Two-Token System
- **Token Development:** Build the SureMint (SMT) token along with the GovernanceMint (GMT) token.
- **Stabilization Mechanisms:** Develop and implement algorithmic controls to minimize price volatility.
- **Testing & Deployment:** Launch a testnet version with thorough unit and integration tests.
- **Security Audits:** Conduct audits and formal verification to ensure system robustness.

### Phase 2: Proving the Impossibility of a Stablecoin with a Two-Token System
- **Theoretical Analysis:** Create mathematical models to demonstrate the challenges and inherent instability of maintaining a perfect peg.
- **Economic Simulations:** Run simulations that examine market dynamics and confirm theoretical findings.
- **Peer Review & Publication:** Publish the analysis to invite academic and community review.

### Phase 3: Validating the Low-Volatility Token Assumption
- **Empirical Testing:** Stress test the SureMint system under diverse market conditions and attack vectors.
- **Security Enhancements:** Identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities through iterative improvements.
- **Documentation & Proof:** Provide detailed documentation and analysis verifying that the low-volatility approach effectively minimizes risks.

# Analysis of Algorithmic Stablecoin Vulnerabilities

## Overview
This repository contains research and analysis of potential vulnerabilities in algorithmic stablecoin systems, specifically focusing on two-token mechanisms. The research demonstrates how these systems, while innovative, may be susceptible to specific attack vectors that could lead to depegging and system collapse.

## Motivation
Stability is crucial for any currency to be adopted by businesses, as they need to minimize exposure to volatility and risks. While the cryptocurrency space offers various stablecoin solutions (mostly centralized ones backed by fiat or gold), decentralized alternatives using a two-token system have emerged. These systems typically consist of:
- A stable token (pegged to fiat)
- A governance token (absorbing volatility)

However, this research identifies fundamental design issues that could potentially cause the stable token to depeg and the governance token to lose value.

## How Two-Token Systems Work

### Basic Mechanism
The system maintains its peg through arbitrage incentives:
- The protocol monitors governance token prices via oracles
- The stable token is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with fiat currency

### Price Stabilization Scenarios

#### When Stable Token Falls Below Peg
- Arbitrageurs buy underpriced stable tokens
- Burn these tokens for governance tokens
- Sell governance tokens for profit
- This process increases stable token demand and reduces supply

#### When Stable Token Exceeds Peg
- Arbitrageurs buy governance tokens
- Burn them for stable tokens
- Sell stable tokens in the market
- This process helps restore the peg

## Vulnerability Analysis

The research identifies a potential attack vector that could destabilize the system while potentially generating profit for the attacker. The attack consists of three main phases:

1. **Initial Position Building**
   - Accumulate governance tokens
   - Convert to stable tokens systematically
   - Wait for peg restoration between operations

2. **Market Positioning**
   - Establish short positions on governance tokens
   - Gradually increase market supply
   - Execute carefully to avoid detection

3. **System Destabilization**
   - Strategic selling of stable tokens
   - Trigger protocol's stabilization mechanisms
   - Potential initiation of a negative feedback loop

## Security Implications

This research highlights the importance of:
- Robust economic design in algorithmic stablecoin systems
- Understanding potential attack vectors
- Implementing protective mechanisms
- Considering systemic risks in decentralized finance
